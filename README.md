# CP_Scripts2
DISCLAIMER: This project is student made with inspiration from other projects such as the scripts made by Ethan Fowler from TEAM BYTE 

FYI- This will be mostly used for a backup location for my scripts and will not always have the most up to date versions.

Usage Instructions For Powershell Scripts:

1.)Run powershell as admin

2.)Navigate to location of script file through powershell ex: cd C:\Users\Michael\Downloads\

3.)In powershell tyoe the following: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
      -Do this to allow the execution of scripts

4.)Once at the location where the script is located type the following: ./cyberWin10.ps1
    Hit Enter

That is it! Good Luck!
