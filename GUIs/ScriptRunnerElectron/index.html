    <h1>Apple CIDR Script Runner - Electron Edition</h1>
    <p>This GUI is built on the Electron API that is used to build applications such as Discord, Slack, and Atom. This
        GUI is currently not in development. This will probably be developed at a later date when the PyQt5 version
        of the script has been completed.</p>
